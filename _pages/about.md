I am a senior pursuing a BS in Mechanical Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Computational Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. My research experience spans multiple domains of mechanical engineering, including the development of dynamic mechanical analysis setups, digital twin modeling of bridges, and reliability studies of thermal interface materials. Through these experiences, I have developed strong foundations in computational methods and multiphysics simulations.
I am passionate about advancing the field of computational mechanics, particularly in developing novel numerical methods and multiscale modeling approaches. I aim to pursue a Ph.D. to contribute to these areas, combining my background in mechanical engineering with computational expertise to solve complex engineering challenges.
