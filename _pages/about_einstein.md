I am Hyunwoo Kwon and I am a senior at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and a minor in Computer Science and Computational Science and Engineering. I have research experiences in diverse fields not limited to development of Dynamical mechanical analysis setup, digital twin of bridges, reliability studies on the thermal interface mnaterials.

After learning more about the computational aspects of Mechanical Engineering, I hope to pursue a Ph.D in the field of computational mechanics, with interests in developing new computational methods for mechanics and multiscale modeling.
